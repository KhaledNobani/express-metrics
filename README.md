# express-metrics

Express middleware for collecting and reporting metrics about response times.

## Installation

Node.js, on project path:

```
npm install express-metrics --save
```

## Examples

Node projects:

```js
var express = require('express');
var metrics = require('express-metrics');
var app = express();

app.use(metrics());

// it responds a JSON with a summary of metrics
app.get('/metrics', metrics.jsonSummary);

// every time this handler returns the greet, the middleware
// will update the metrics with the calculated response time
app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
  res.json({ greet: 'Hello world!' });
});
```

In /metrics path, you  will see:
```js
{
  'GET_/': {
    type: "timer",
    duration: {
      type: "histogram",
      min: 1,
      max: 49,
      sum: 140,
      variance: 136.69005847953213,
      mean: 7.368421052631579,
      std_dev: 11.691452368270253,
      count: 19,
      median: 2,
      p75: 5,
      p95: 49,
      p99: 49,
      p999: 49
    },
    rate: {
      type: "meter",
      count: 19,
      m1: 0.09594670244481206,
      m5: 0.019860059817214587,
      m15: 0.007863370827271138,
      mean: 0.008451182854240225,
      unit: "seconds"
    }
  }
}
```
Metrics are grouped by:
  - method and path (i.e. GET_/)
  - response status (i.e. status_200)
  - all requests

If you want to do something with the collected data:

```js
app.get('/metrics', function (req, res, next) {
  var homeMetrics = metrics.getSummary()['GET_/']; // only home metrics
  res.render('path/to/template', { home: homeMetrics });
});
```
